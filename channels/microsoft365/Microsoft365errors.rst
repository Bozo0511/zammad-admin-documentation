Microsoft 365 common errors
===========================

**The** :doc:`documentation </channels/microsoft365/index>` **is your
friend** ðŸ˜Š

Incorrect client ID
-------------------

**Error message:** AADSTS00016: Application with identifier
'xxxxxxxx' was not found in the directory 'MSFT'. This can happen if the
application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or
consented to by any user in the tenant. You may have sent your authentication
request to the wrong tenant.

In this case, please compare whether the client ID created in Zammad
matches that in Azure for the Azure App.

The Client ID can be found in Zammad under 
Settings > Channels > Microsoft 365 > App Configuration. 
See :doc:`here </channels/microsoft365/accounts>` how to find the client 
ID in Azure and where to copy it to in Zammad.

Wrong or expired client secret
------------------------------

**Error message:** 500: We're sorry, but something went wrong. 

.. figure:: /images/channels/microsoft365/errors/Micro1.png

  :scale: 90%
  :align: center
	  
This error occurs when the client uses an incorrect or expired client secret.

.. warning:: **Important notice:**
  We never ask the client for the client secret as this can potentially be a
  security risk. We ask the customer to create a new client secret and copy the
  value and not the ID to Zammad.

See :doc:`here </channels/microsoft365/accounts>` for more information.

Wrong tenant
------------

**Error message:** AADSTS0023: Specified tenant identifier 'xxxxxxxx' is
neither a valid DNS name, nor a valid external domain.

.. figure:: /images/channels/microsoft365/errors/wrong-tenant.png
  :alt: Error message
  :scale: 90%
  :align: center
	  
If a wrong tenant is used in Zammad or the email account is not a member of
the tenant created in Zammad, this error message occurs.

In this case, please check if the tenant is entered correctly in
Zammad, or remove the tenant complete.

.. warning:: **Important notice:**
  Once the tenant is completely removed, all email accounts can be created in
  Zammad regardless of which tenant the email account is a member of.

Request admin consent
---------------------

**Prompt:** approval required

.. figure:: /images/channels/microsoft365/errors/admin-request.png
  :alt: Error message
  :scale: 90%
  :align: center
	  
This message occurs when the admin tries to create an email account in Zammad
that has not yet received approval from the Azure global admin.

In our documentation,
:doc:`step-by-step instructions </channels/microsoft365/accounts/account-setup>`
can be found on how to request admin consent from Zammad.

.. note::
  The request for the admin consent can be bypassed by assigning the admin
  consent in Azure to the App.

  Home > App Registration > Manage > API Permission > Grant admin consent for
  "MSFT".

Missing permissions for the Azure user
--------------------------------------

**Error message:** Can't use Chanel:Driver::SMTPAuthentificationError:Net::SMTPAuthentificationError

  Error message in the ticket

This error occurs when the admin wants to create an email account in Zammad
whose user does not have permission for SMTP authentication to the mail server.


**Private email account:**

In this case, the admin must grant the SMTP authentication permission to the
user of the inbox.

Permission is provided at https://admin.microsoft.com

Users > Active Users > click Users > Email > Manage Email Apps

Add SMTP authentication permission here.

**Shared inbox:**

This isn't a Zammad problem, so we can only help to a limited extent here.
Try to enable "SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled" in Azure shell.

If not installed::

   Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement

Log in to Exchange using Powershell::

   Connect-ExchangeOnline

Switching on the SMTP authentication for a mailbox - also possible with a
shared mailbox::

   Set-CASMailbox -Identity name@domain.net -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $false
